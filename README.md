This experience is more important than rushing to the free work, as you will not get it easy with your free work, and you will not be able to refine the method of work or delivery of projects Free and professional work.  &lt;h1>Your vision and interests are identical to the company team&lt;/h1>  It is not necessarily the interpretation of this fantasy picture in the atmosphere of happy work and the various daily activities with the team is completely unrealistic, especially in the field of technical work and the pressures that result from it, but you can distinguish it with simple things .. For example when you do not feel the passage of time on your work day, Many of the reasons that do not drive you to go to another company, and yes, sometimes simple things but live and traffic makes them articulated in the field of career.  &lt;h1>The possibility of career development&lt;/h1>  Even if you are starting a government job, but whether you are a government institution or a private company. If you have the opportunity to develop career "whether to get a higher position, or to receive new tasks greater than the current tasks, or your promotion of material and moral from time to time may not be necessary Urgent "current time" leave the job and go to free work.  &lt;h1>When you intend to work part-time&lt;/h1>  When you start receiving free-side work, feel potential or increase it over time, and see your access to free business but do not have the courage or the current customer base that encourages you to leave the job completely, then it is best not to leave it completely, Partial as an initial or even long-term solution.  &lt;h1>When you do not like the area in which you work&lt;/h1>  This part is not strange or false. Many people do not like the area in which they function, and therefore you will not be able to go to work freely. Your chances of success will be very small. There are so many difficulties, so logical thinking is to prepare yourself for a career shift to the field where you love to work and then to think later about free work. "Self-employment will not be the biggest concern of its time" compared to the direction you love.  &lt;h1>When certain qualities of free work are not suitable for you&lt;/h1>  Recognizing that a large part of these qualities are acquired, but some deserve to be seriously considered when you want to go to free work,  &lt;ul>&lt;li>If you do not like working alone or can not.&lt;/li>  &lt;li>You do not have the ability or opportunity to bring in new customers.&lt;/li>  &lt;li>You do not have experience or experience managing projects or managing time.&lt;/li>  &lt;li>Do not like or can not deal directly with more than one person and one head to work.&lt;/li>  &lt;li>Do not have the ability to constantly motivate yourself and deal with depression and fear.&lt;/li>  &lt;li>You do not have the capacity or the ability to deal with income disparities and differences.&lt;/li>  &lt;li>You do not have the ability or the business advantage to manage and develop your business continuously.&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>  &lt;h1>And finally&lt;/h1>  And as free work has great features that belong to it and are unique to them, the job is very profitable, especially in the cases that I mentioned in this post, but away from all that remains one important attribute that must be mentioned before thinking about self-employment,  If you think for a moment that free work is easier than a job, and that means freedom, you have to think carefully about it, and recognizing that the most important and most important thing you must develop yourself is patience and confidence that the spouse and the conciliator in any step or field, Or free is God Almighty
